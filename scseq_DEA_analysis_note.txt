For analyzing multiple single‐cell RNA-seq datasets (e.g., 5 healthy and 10 cancer samples). 

Keep in mind that while workflows can vary depending on the specifics of real data and questions, the following general pipeline is commonly used:

1. Initial Quality Control (QC) on Each Sample Separately
Assess Data Quality:
Examine basic metrics (e.g., total counts per cell, number of detected genes, percentage of mitochondrial or ribosomal gene expression).
Identify and filter out low-quality cells, dead cells, and potential doublets (tools like Scrublet or DoubletFinder can help).
Visualize QC Metrics:
Create histograms or scatter plots (e.g., gene counts vs. mitochondrial percentage) to decide on filtering thresholds.
Tip: Running QC on individual samples helps you understand the quality and any technical biases in each dataset before integration.

2. Normalization and Feature Selection
Normalization:
Normalize the gene expression counts (e.g., log-normalization or variance-stabilizing transformations) to make cells comparable.
Identify Highly Variable Genes (HVGs):
Select HVGs that capture most of the biological variability; these genes are used in downstream analyses.
Scaling:
Scale the data (center and scale the expression values) for each gene.

3. Data Integration / Batch Correction
Integrate Datasets:
Since your samples come from different conditions and possibly different batches, integrate them to remove batch effects while preserving biological variation.
Methods include Seurat’s integration anchors, Harmony, or other integration frameworks.
Assess Integration:
Use dimensionality reduction plots (e.g., UMAP or t-SNE) colored by sample or batch to ensure that cells from different samples mix well if they are biologically similar.

4. Dimensionality Reduction
Perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining most of the variation.
Non-linear Embedding (UMAP/t-SNE):
Use UMAP or t-SNE for 2D/3D visualization. This helps in understanding the overall structure and relationships among cells.

5. Clustering
Cluster Cells:
Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., Louvain or Leiden) on the reduced dimensions to group cells into clusters that are likely to represent distinct cell populations.
Tune Resolution:
Experiment with different resolution parameters to capture both broad and subtle subpopulations.

6. Cell Type Annotation
Identify Marker Genes:
For each cluster, identify genes that are specifically or highly expressed.
Assign Cell Identities:
Use known marker genes or automated annotation tools (e.g., SingleR, scCATCH) to assign likely cell types.
Validate Annotations:
Cross-check with literature or reference datasets to ensure that the annotations make biological sense.

7. Differential Expression Analysis
Within-Cell-Type Comparisons:
Key Point: Compare the same cell types across conditions (e.g., healthy vs. cancer cells of the same type) rather than comparing across different cell types. This controls for cell type–specific expression patterns and ensures that differences are due to condition rather than cell identity.
Statistical Testing:
Use appropriate statistical tests to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within each cell type.
Further Analysis:
Perform pathway or gene set enrichment analyses on the DEGs to gain insights into the underlying biological processes.

8. Downstream Analyses
Pathway and Network Analysis:
Explore pathways, gene regulatory networks, or cell–cell interactions that might be altered between conditions.
Trajectory / Pseudotime Analysis:
If your data suggests dynamic processes (e.g., differentiation or tumor progression), consider trajectory inference.
Integration with Clinical Data:
If available, correlate your findings with clinical outcomes or other metadata.

Final Considerations
Iterative Process:
Often, need to revisit earlier steps (e.g., adjusting QC thresholds or integration parameters) as understand the real data better.
Comparison Strategy:
When performing differential expression, focus on comparing similar cell types across conditions to avoid confounding effects due to differences in cellular composition.
Tools and Pipelines:
Popular frameworks like Seurat (R) or Scanpy (Python) offer robust pipelines that align well with the steps above.
