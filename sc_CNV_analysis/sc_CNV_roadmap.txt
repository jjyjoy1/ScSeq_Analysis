This workflow follows these main steps:

The code provides an end-to-end solution with the following stages:

Cell Ranger Processing: Aligns FASTQ files to produce gene expression matrices
Quality Control: Filters cells and genes based on standard QC metrics
Data Integration: Merges tumor and normal samples using scVI
CNV Analysis: Uses inferCNVpy to detect copy number variations
Visualization: Creates plots of CNV results

Key Features

Modular Design: Each processing step is separated into functions for better readability and customization
QC Parameters: Configurable filtering thresholds for mitochondrial genes, UMI counts, etc.
Integration Strategy: Uses scVI's powerful neural network approach for batch correction
Reference Selection: Allows selection of specific cell types as CNV references
Visualization: Comprehensive visualization of CNV results by clusters and conditions


Key points to remember when working with inferCNVpy on scRNA-seq data:

Reference cell selection is crucial - immune cells or stromal cells make good references as they're less likely to harbor CNVs.
The approach works best for detecting large-scale chromosomal alterations rather than small focal events.
Gene position annotations must match the genome build used in your Cell Ranger alignment.
Integration with scVI before CNV analysis helps correct for techn
