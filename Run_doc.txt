#Run the scTCR analysis using:
#sample_infor.csv contains sampel name, file name and file path
python scTCR_analysis.py --data_dir /path/to/fastq_files --output_dir /path/to/output --sample_info sample_info.csv

#If you need gene expression analysis
python scTCR_analysis.py --data_dir /path/to/fastq_files --output_dir /path/to/output --sample_info sample_info.csv --gene_expression /path/to/expression.h5



#Key Features of the Pipeline:

1.Raw Data Processing:
Extracts TCR sequences from fastq.gz files using Cell Ranger
Performs quality control of the TCR sequences

2.TCR Sequence Analysis:
Annotates V(D)J gene segments
Identifies CDR3 regions
Assigns clonotypes and compiles repertoire information

3.Feature Analysis:
V(D)J gene usage patterns
CDR3 length distribution
Motif identification within CDR3 sequences
Clonal expansion analysis

4.Repertoire Metrics:
Diversity calculations (Shannon entropy, Simpson index, clonality)
Repertoire overlap between samples (Jaccard, Morisita-Horn)

5.Comparative Analysis:
Statistical comparison between conditions (e.g., healthy vs. disease)
Identification of differentially used V genes
Differences in CDR3 features and clonal expansion

6.Integration with Gene Expression (Optional):
Links TCR data with gene expression profiles
Performs differential expression analysis
Maps clonotypes to cell clusters

7.Visualization:
Comprehensive plots for all analysis steps
Interactive HTML report summarizing results


#For scBCR data analysis using: 
python scBCR_analysis.py --data_dir /path/to/fastq_files --output_dir /path/to/output --sample_info sample_info.csv

python scBCR_analysis.py --data_dir /path/to/fastq_files --output_dir /path/to/output --sample_info sample_info.csv  --gene_expression /path/to/expression.h5

#Key Features of the BCR Analysis Pipeline:

1.Raw Data Processing:
Extracts BCR sequences from fastq.gz files using Cell Ranger (with BCR-specific parameters)
Performs quality control of the sequences

2.BCR Sequence Analysis:
Annotates V(D)J gene segments for both heavy and light chains
Identifies CDR3 regions
Assigns clonotypes and compiles repertoire information

3.Isotype Analysis (BCR-specific):
Identifies and characterizes isotype distribution (IgM, IgD, IgG1-4, IgA1-2, IgE)
Compares isotype frequencies between conditions

4.Somatic Hypermutation Analysis (BCR-specific):
Calculates mutation rates relative to germline sequences
Analyzes mutation patterns by isotype and chain type

5.B-cell Lineage Reconstruction (BCR-specific):
Builds lineage trees based on sequence similarity
Visualizes evolutionary relationships between clonally related B cells

6.Feature Analysis:
V(D)J gene usage patterns
CDR3 length distribution
Motif identification
Physicochemical properties of CDR3 sequences

7.Repertoire Metrics:
Diversity calculations
Repertoire overlap between samples
Clonal expansion analysis

8.Comparative Analysis:
Statistical comparison between conditions
Identifies differentially used V genes
Analyzes differences in CDR3 features, isotypes, and SHM patterns

9.Integration with Gene Expression (Optional):
Links BCR data with gene expression profiles
Performs B-cell subtype analysis
Correlates gene expression with isotype switching

10.Visualization:
Comprehensive plots for all analysis steps
Interactive HTML report summarizing results
