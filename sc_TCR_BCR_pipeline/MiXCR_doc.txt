MiXCR is a powerful command-line tool, which is also popular TCR/BCT analysis tools,  specifically designed for immune repertoire analysis from sequencing data, with excellent capabilities for extracting TCR and BCR sequences from raw sequencing files.
Key Features of the MiXCR-based Analysis Pipeline:

Data Processing with MiXCR:
Processes FASTQ files directly using MiXCR's specialized algorithms
Employs built-in presets optimized for TCR or BCR data
Supports both single-end and paired-end sequencing data
Extracts UMI and cell barcode information for single-cell analysis

V(D)J Analysis:
Performs accurate V(D)J gene segment annotation
Identifies CDR3 regions and calculates clone frequencies
Analyzes gene usage patterns across samples and conditions
Creates detailed V-J pairing visualizations

CDR3 Sequence Analysis:
Length distribution and physicochemical properties
Amino acid composition and motif identification
Statistical comparison between experimental conditions

Clonal Expansion Analysis:
Measures repertoire clonality and diversity
Identifies and characterizes expanded clonotypes
Uses multiple diversity metrics (Shannon entropy, clonality, Gini index)

Isotype Analysis (BCR-specific):
Quantifies isotype distribution (IgM, IgG1-4, IgA1-2, etc.)
Compares isotype usage between conditions


Comparative Analysis:
Statistical comparison between experimental conditions
Identifies differentially used V genes and expanded clonotypes
Analyzes differences in CDR3 features


Comprehensive Visualization:
Creates detailed plots for all analyses
Generates an HTML summary report with key findings
